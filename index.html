                My name is Jacqueline Palacios and I created this site in order to share my HTML journey.
                I am a senior at Athens State and my major is Information Technology. This is my first time taking a course in HTMl. I began this
                course in January and have learned so much. I began with simple HTML elements and advanced
                all the way to Bootstrap. The page you are currently viewing is coded with Bootstrap. For my first time coding in HTML, I have been surprised at what I could do.
                I've only scratched the surface but am going to continue my journey in learning HTML.
                I would like to share with you my development and design journey, so please follow along
                and enjoy your stay on my page!

                This Relative page is one of the first pages I had created when I began my journey.
                If you click the button below the image, it will open up a new page directing you
                to the site. As you can see on the site, there is not much to the site. There are no
                colors, nothing to make the site pop. The most interesting element on this page is
                 the ordered list where I listed my favorite characters from my favorite game series,
                 Genshin Impact. Even though the elements I had added to the page were simple, it was
                 still enough to make me overjoyed. My favorite part about coding in HTML is that you
                 are able to see your page grow with each element that you add. I have two more
                 iterations of this page to share with you and with each you will see its immense growth.

                    For one of our assignments, we were tasked with creating a Brasilian Street Food Restaurant.
                    We were allowed to have total creative freedom for what we added to the site and I ran with it.
                    From it, Brasil de Athens was born. Styles had not been introduced yet, so my pages
                    were still missing color, but I had made up for this in colorful images. I had added
                    the essentials for a restaurant: an introduction, the menu, business hours, and
                    an introduction to the food for people unfamiliar with it. On this page, there is a link to the menu.
                    This page greets the customers of Brasil de Athens and delivers their mission statement. Below,
                    there is a small menu showcasing the restaurant's selection. Their selection includes appetizers,
                    their entrees, and desserts.

                For our midterm, we were tasked with creating a website for a travel agency, MAXimum WELLness.
                We needed to create a homepage, a New Years Trip page, a Spring Break Trip, and a form page.
                This was one of the pages where my creative side came out. I had fun planning a page for this agency
                and was proud of what I delivered. The home page goes in depth about the company and there are
                bookmarks to take you to each section of the page without scrolling. The two trips at the top of the
                page lead you to the trip's respective travel destination. Here, there is information about the
                destination, the hotel, attractions, and a link to that trip's interest form. On this form, customers
                would fill in their contact information to allow the agency to gauge interest for its trips.
                It was not easy to create these pages, but I was quite happy with the results.
            </p>

                <div id="RelativeGrid" class="row text-center">
                    <div class="col-md-8">
                <h2>Relative Grid</h2>
                <div class="well">
                <p onmousedown="myFunction(this,'blue')" onmouseup="myFunction(this,'black')">
                    These final two pages will show what the final iterations of the Relative page look like. This was
                    my first hand at coding a CSS (Cascading Style Sheet). This is one way to style your
                    web pages. As you can see, there was an overhaul of the site and more information was added.
                    While I had a bit of difficulty with figuring out CSS, I was amazed at the results, even if
                    it wasn't perfect. I think CSS gave me the most difficulty during the course. I much prefer
                    using it to add interactivity to pages, which you will see in the final iteration of the page.
                    I added information about the company who produced Genshin, an introduction to the game, 
                    my opinion of the game, a bit of background on the characters, and a footer including the
                    company's contact information.

                        This is the final page in my journey. I believe it is the best to share last since there are some
                        cool features added to it. This was when we added interactivity to our pages through CSS, jQuery,
                        and Javascript. To my surprise, this was not as difficult as I expected to code. To add this functionality
                        to your page, you simply just have to link external files where you have added these functions to.
                        I enjoyed choosing what parts of my page I would add interactivity to. Images expand if you hover 
                        over them, the heading changes colors, the nav bar increases in size for each link, and there are 
                        two neat buttons added that change parts of the page.

                            Overall, I immensely enjoyed this class. I had only had experience with coding programs, so I
                            I had no idea until this class that it was so easy to code HTML. Having a fantastic professor
                            helped as well. My favorite way to add style and interactivity was handsdown Bootstrap. As I
                            stated before, the most troublesome part of my journey was learning CSS. It's definitely a skill
                            I would like to improve. If there is any inkling of desire in you to learn HTML, take it.
                            I was not sure if I was skilled enough to learn it, but it was so much fun. I am actually planning
                            on helping a friend make a website with what I have learned. One of the best parts of HTML is that
                            there are endless resources to learn from, and you are able to see your page at each stage of development.
                            I hope you have enjoyed your stay on my page. It's time for you to start your own journey through HTML.
